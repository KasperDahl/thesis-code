# I need to evaluate the suggested matches based on the following issues (for scikit EM):
# 1. Link score might be really low - should be above (or below) a certain score
# 2. One individual might be linked to more than one other


# Comparison of small test set (eg. "junget_1850_1845") to manually linked full set (eg. "1850_to_1845_full")
# Withdraw all unique indices from source_1 (eg. 1850) - find the relevant id1
